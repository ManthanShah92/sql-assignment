An interim constraint violation is caused by a change that removes the violation such that the constraint is met, all within a single statement and transaction. SQL Server checks for interim constraint violations for self-referencing DELETE statements, INSERT, and multi-row UPDATE statements. This checking requires more work tables. With this trace flag you can disallow interim constraint violations, thus requiring fewer work tables.</td>

    	<td>Disables the costing of pseudo-merge joins, thus significantly reducing time spent on the parse for certain types of large, multi-table joins. One can also use SET FORCEPLAN ON to disable the costing of pseudo-merge joins because the query is forced to use the order specified in the FROM clause.</td>

Later, the deleted record is purged by the ghost record removal process. When you disable this process, the deleted record is not purged. Therefore, the space that the deleted record consumes is not freed. This behavior affects space consumption and the performance of scan operations. SCOPE: Global. If you turn off this trace flag, the ghost record removal process works correctly.</td>

		<td>Cause 'DBCC-style' page auditing to be performed whenever a database page is read into the buffer pool. This is useful to catch cases where pages are being corrupted in memory and then written out to disk with a new page checksum. When they're read back in the checksum will look correct, but the page is corrupt (because of the previous memory corruption). This page auditing goes someway to catching this - especially on non-Enterprise Edition systems that don't have the 'checksum sniffer'.

		<td>SQL 8 – Limits the amount of Lazy Write activity.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>815</td>
		<td>Enables latch enforcement. SQL Server 8 (with service pack 4) and SQL Server 9 can perform latch enforcement for data pages found in the buffer pool cache. Latch enforcement changes the virtual memory protection state while database page status changes from "clean" to "dirty" ("dirty" means modified through INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE operation). If an attempt is made to modify a data page while latch enforcement is set, it causes an exception and creates a mini-dump in SQL Server installation's LOG directory. Microsoft support can examine the contents of such mini-dump to determine the cause of the exception. In order to modify the data page the connection must first acquire a modification latch. Once the data modification latch is acquired the page protection is changed to read-write. Once the modification latch is released the page protection changes back to read-only.</td></tr></table>
